# ZoeStatus

This app is a replacement for the "official" Renault "Z.E Services" app on the AppStore. 
It currently only covers a small part of the functionality:
- Battery state of charge (% and km)
- Charger state (e.g. speed)
- A/C preconditioning trigger and result of last command (experimental)



The goal is to provide easier access to the most useful features than the official app.


It is based on the reverse engineered API documented here: https://github.com/edent/Renault-Zoe-API

## Prerequisites:

- Renault "Zero Emission" vehicle, e.g. Renault ZOE
- Active "Renault ZE services" account (https://www.services.renault-ze.com)
